        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jashandeep Singh. I am an Indian citizen. I am a college student and I have opted for <b>Media Design - co-op option</b> in <b>Algonquin College, Ottawa</b>. My goal is to become a Photographer. Listening music is my hobby and this is what I do in my free time. Specially the instrumental music, it gives me comfort and helps me relax.

            I can say that I am a responsible and hard-working student. I like to learn new things. Moreover, being a social person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. My friends says that I am a very funny and interesting guy with a good sense of humour. I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We find and experience new things about each other.

            This is one of my favourite motivational quote.
