        <p>
            My name is Jashandeep Singh. I am an Indian citizen. I am a college student and I have opted for <b>Media Design - co-op option</b> in <b>Algonquin College, Ottawa</b>. My goal is to become a Photographer. I like to travel and capture memories. There are so many things which I love to do. 
            These are my hobbies listed below. 
        </p>    

            <ul>
                <li>Singing</li>
                <li>Listening music, specially the instrumental music, it gives me comfort and helps me relax.</li>
                <li>Playing video games</li>
            
            </ul>
        

        <p>
            I can say that I am a responsible and hard-working student. I like to learn new things. Moreover, being a social person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. My friends says that I am a very funny and interesting guy with a good sense of humour. I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We find and experience new things about each other.
